# Import only specific functions
Import square and cube from "examples/math_library.abc".

Declare result to be 0.
Set result to the result of calling square with 4.
Print "square(4) =", the value of result.

Set result to the result of calling cube with 2.
Print "cube(2) =", the value of result.

# Try to use isEven which should not be available
# This would cause an error if uncommented:
# Set result to the result of calling isEven with 4.
